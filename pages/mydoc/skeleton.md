The skeleton of a structure is an **undirected** graph where edges suggest some relationship between variables, but do not assert the **direction** of this relationship.

[Insert skeleton example]

This is of significance as constraint-based structure learning algorithms, such as PC, independently learn the skeleton and direction.
